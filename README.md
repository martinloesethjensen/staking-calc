# Staking Calculator

This is a simple staking calculator that imitates staking a crypto-currency and then has the option of redeeming rewards if any.

The application is only to showcase some utilization of software design patterns.  

## Idea

As a HODLer I want to grow my crypto portfolio and one way of doing that is through staking tokens that you already have and then earn rewards after a period.

## Patterns 

This application need to use at least 4 patterns from the GoF, one from each pattern category; creational, behavioral, and structural.
Then one more of own choice.

### Command Pattern

The command pattern is a behavioral pattern.

TODO: Write about this pattern and why it is good in this application

### Facade Pattern

The facade pattern is a structural pattern.

TODO: Write about this pattern and why it is good in this application

### Factory Method Pattern

The factory method pattern is a creational pattern.
